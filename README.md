# Crypto App
This project is all about designing a Crypto Trading App with a modern UI using the latest features offered by Android Studio. In a total of three parts, we will create a unique home screen containing all the necessary information on one page, use the app to visualize our cryptocurrency price data, and animate the charts for a satisfying user experience.
